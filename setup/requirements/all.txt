# EMPO - All Dependencies Combined
#
# This file includes all requirements for full development and experimentation.
# Use this if you want everything installed at once.

#   - dev.txt: Development tools (includes base.txt)
#   - colab.txt: Google Colab environment
#   - kaggle.txt: Kaggle environment
#   - hierarchical.txt: MineLand/LLM dependencies

# Core production dependencies
