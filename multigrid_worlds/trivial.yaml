# Possible goals for the human agent (yellow, agent 1)
# Probabilities match the original code's goal sampler
possible_goals:
  - "2,1"  # Easy once robot has pushed rock (or moved back)
  - "1,1"  # Medium difficulty
  - "3,1"  # Hardest - robot must move back after pushing rock
  - "2,2"  # Already at starting position
  - "1,2"  # Impossible goal (in wall) - for testing edge cases
  - "4,1"  # Impossible goal (out of bounds) - included to cover all walkable cells

# Note on state space:
# With 4 human orientations × 4 robot orientations × (1 + 3 + 12) rock positions
# Total states = 256
# In tabular mode, lookup tables should eventually reach:
#   - x_h: 256 entries
#   - q_r: 256 entries  
#   - v_h_e: 256 × 5 goals = 1280 entries
