# EMPO - Minimal requirements for Google Colab
# 
# This file contains the minimum required dependencies to run EMPO in Google Colab.
# For full functionality, see requirements.txt.
#
# Installation in Colab:
#   !pip install -q -r requirements-colab.txt
#
# Note: PyTorch is NOT included here because Colab pre-installs it.
# For CPU-only environments, you may need to install PyTorch separately:
#   !pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# Core scientific computing (numpy is pre-installed in Colab)
numpy>=1.24.0
scipy>=1.10.0

# Reinforcement Learning frameworks
gymnasium>=0.28.0
pettingzoo>=1.24.0

# Utilities
cloudpickle>=3.0.0
PyYAML>=6.0
matplotlib>=3.7.0

# Optional: graphviz for DAG visualization (also needs apt-get install graphviz)

# Note: The following are OPTIONAL and NOT included by default:
# - tensorboard>=2.13.0  (uncomment if needed for logging)
# - wandb>=0.15.0        (uncomment if needed for experiment tracking)
# - mpi4py>=3.1.0        (NOT recommended for Colab - MPI not supported)
